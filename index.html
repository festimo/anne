  "welcome all home for every one"
</h2>

<p>
i am recycling polythene in my society because i have come to realise that there are so many polythenes all over the streets.
they have made the environment to appear so ugly and bad.
this company has come up with the cheap supportive and environmentally friendly plostic shoes tanks and water pipes to solve  this problem<br>
</p>
<p>
they contain toxic substances that pollutes the environment;like in the soil it affects soil stucture, it also lowers the soil ph and soil fer
tility
</p>
<p>
am using these polythenes to make shoes from them and tanks for wate storage and pipes for water distribution service
they are 100% non- toxic to the environment because they will be mechanically formed and they will be very hard and long lasting.this will
be due to  the ash that is added to the polythenes during manufacturing<br>
</p>
<p>
  the shoes offered is cheep compared to the others and will be readilly available since the company will be workin
every day and every time to make it effective.The company will also offer free shoes to the customers according
to there rate of buying.
</p>
<p>
the tanks will be manufactured and supplied in several quantities in different capacities and they will have
different prices according to the litres of water the tank can hold.The pipes are also supplied to water distributer companies<br>
through these the society will have benefit alot
</p>
<p>
  the polythenes are used in making slippers,making gumboot and also making marigold flowers from plasticbags and making beautiful baskets<br>
